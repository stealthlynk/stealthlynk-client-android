## Building the Project

### Option 1: Automatic xray binary download (Recommended)

1. Run the included download script to automatically download and install the xray binaries:
   ```
   cd StealthLynkXrayAndroid
   chmod +x download_xray.sh
   ./download_xray.sh
   ```
   This script will download xray binaries for all supported architectures and place them in the correct jniLibs folders.

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync Gradle files

4. Build the project:
   ```
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   
   Or for a release build:
   ```
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

### Option 2: Manual xray binary installation

1. Download xray binaries from the official repository: https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases

2. Place the renamed `xray` executables in:
   - `app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/xray` (for 64-bit ARM devices)
   - `app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/xray` (for 32-bit ARM devices)
   - `app/src/main/jniLibs/x86_64/xray` (for 64-bit x86 devices)
   - `app/src/main/jniLibs/x86/xray` (for 32-bit x86 devices)

3. Follow steps 2-4 from Option 1 above.

## Running the App

1. Install the APK on your device:
   ```
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

2. Launch the StealthLynk app

3. Grant VPN permissions when prompted

4. Add a server using a VLESS URL or QR code

5. Tap the connection button to connect

## Adding Servers

Servers can be added in two ways:

1. Manually entering a VLESS URL in the format:
   ```
   vless://uuid@host:port?security=reality&encryption=none&pbk=publickey&fp=chrome&type=tcp&flow=xtls-rprx-vision&sni=domain.com&sid=shortid#Remark
   ```

2. Scanning a QR code containing a valid VLESS URL (tap the QR code button on the Servers tab)

## Security Features
